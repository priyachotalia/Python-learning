PYTHON LEARNING
Week 1 is all out learning the basisc of python such as string manipulation, control structure and learning how to draw and plot in python using jupyter notebook. It gave me an over view os what python is and how it can be useful for data visulisation and analysis.  

In Week 2, we practised writing markdown. Then we learned Python data structures which includes pandas module that supports data structures designed for handling the dataset. Three datasets have been imported in week 2 practical to conduct analysis on some basic functions.

Week 3 is the begining of some basic data visualtion and analysis. Two sample datasets have been taken and analysis have been performed on them. 

Week 4 is about using Seaborn library to visualise the dataset. 

Week 5 was all about exploring the dataset, building models, making predictions andevaluating results. Simple linear least squares model is created using two different datasets. The first is the standard Iris dataset describing flowers, the second is the AutoMPG dataset. Data was split into train and test dataset and them predictions were made.

In Week 6, we learned logistic regression using breat-cancer-wisconsin dataset. In this week, we learned a new feature to drop the null values columns as it can affect the accury ofthe dataset. The data was slip into train and test dataset and predictions were made. Confusion matrix was used to check which model is doing good and which model is creating an error.

Week 9 Practical â€“ KNN Classifier and Model Selection
Week 9 is about supervised learning using the k-nearest neigbour (KNN) model. Iris dataset has been taken to build a model that will learn from the measurements of these irises whose species is known, so that we can predict the species for a new iris. 

Week 10 Practical - In week 10, we learned about another supervised model called Navie Bayes Classifier. It is based on applying Bayes' theorem.
